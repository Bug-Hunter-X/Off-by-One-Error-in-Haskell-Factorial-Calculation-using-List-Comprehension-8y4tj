This Haskell code attempts to use a list comprehension to calculate factorials, but it contains a subtle off-by-one error in its recursion.

```haskell
factorials :: [Integer]
factorials = [factorial n | n <- [0..]]

factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

The issue lies in the base case of the `factorial` function. When `n` reaches 0, it correctly returns 1. However, the list comprehension starts from 0, meaning that `factorial 0` is immediately invoked. While not directly causing a crash, it leads to an infinite loop when negative values are attempted to be calculated from the recursion, as the factorial calculation for negative numbers is not defined.
